# Readiness probes are used to let kubelet know when the application is ready to accept new traffic.
# If the application needs some time to initialize state after the process has started, configure the 
# readiness probe to tell Kubernetes to wait before sending new traffic. A primary use case for readiness 
# probes is directing traffic to deployments behind a service.
# One important thing to note with readiness probes is that it runs during the podâ€™s entire lifecycle.
